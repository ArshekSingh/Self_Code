4) get and load difference in hibernate?
5) update and merge difference in hibernate?
6) How many Session Factory objects can we have in our application? Why restrict it to one only?
7) Questions related to String pool by having two questions, one using equals method on two string instances with same value ("abc") and other having two Student instances where 1) Student class has nothing 2) Student class has some data members.

Second Round:
1) Tell one instance where you there was a design flaw in the project and you have implemented a better design approach and optimised the code using new design.

}
}
